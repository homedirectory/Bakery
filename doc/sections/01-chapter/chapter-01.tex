\subsection{OrderItem}

After adding the Order to the database, You can edit the content of Order using the OrderItem Entity. The OrderItem entity describes the relationship between an Order and the Products in that Entity. 

In order to add a new OrderItem entity one should choose an Order which it wants to edit using order number, and choose the Product that belongs to the chosen Order from the list of available products and the quantity of the Product. 

So, OrderItem has the following fields/properties:


- Order →  required fields which represents the order to which content will be added to.

- Product →  required field which represents the products which will be added to this order.

- Quantity →  required, integer which represents the quantity of product ordered.


For example, if a User has created an Order with the following parameters:

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sections/01-chapter/images/order13.png}

Then they can add the content of that Order using OrderItem Entity. Let the Order under id ORD-000001 from Kozelnytska, 2a to Kulparkivska, 200a on 28.12.2020 00:00 contain the Products : Croissant with chocolate 150  pieces and Napoleon cake 10 pieces.

The Warning under the Product informs about a minimum preferable product amount in a single order that is equal 2.One should accept it to proceed.

Some of the restrictions which are important with the OrderItem entity:
No more than 10 products can be added to an order. The least amount of types of products in an order is set to 3. The user is not able to add the same product, if it is already added.

Thus the content of an order can be visible by the search in the OrderItem table using the search criteria → orderNo.

There are multiple roles a User can have in a System. The roles can be created manually. The roles can have different access to data as well as to what one can do within a System.

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sections/01-chapter/images/system13.png}

The creation of a new role requires the filling of the information about Role Title as well as description. In order for a system to be able to interact with the set Role the Active option should be turned on.


\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sections/01-chapter/images/system14.png}

By default we created the ADMIN role. 
The Security Matrix item describes what each role can have access to. 

The tokens do not enable the action by themself. A User has a particular role then it is authorized to make some actions. For example, a user with ADMIN role is authorized to add, edit and delete all the information related to User Entity as well as Person Entity.  

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sections/01-chapter/images/system155.png}

During the assignment of the authorization zones You should be aware that the zones are nested and the outermost will be the one a user will have access to.
